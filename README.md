# To-Do-List
A simple and elegant to-do list web app, with multiple lists and a functioning backend.

Visit https://sleepy-dusk-34827.herokuapp.com/ to check out the app.

Click on the drop-down menu in the navbar labelled "Your Lists" to choose another list.
To add an item to list, type it in the text-box and hit the add icon.

Click on the check-box next to an item to delete it.

The data is being stored in MongoDB Atlas.

This was my first project with a database deployed in the cloud.

Hope you like it! :)
